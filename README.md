# TML-Effect

Translation metalanguage of effects has been developed in the TNTC project supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) 19H05660: [Developing a Translation Process Model and Constructing an Integrated Translation Environment Through Detailed Descriptions of Translation Norms and Competences](https://tntc.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

## Contents
